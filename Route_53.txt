Route53
------------

 AWS Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) 
 web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
 It is used for domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking of resources.

Why is it called Route 53?
-------------------------

The name Route 53 comes from "Route" (used in networking) and "53" (the port number for DNS traffic, TCP/UDP port 53).


Route 53 routing policeis
---------------------------------

Simple Routing: Maps a domain to a single IP or resource (default behavior).

Weighted Routing: Distributes traffic across multiple endpoints based on assigned weights.

Latency-based Routing:Directs users to the lowest latency AWS region.

Failover Routing: Automatically redirects traffic to a healthy resource in case of failure.

Geolocation Routing: Routes traffic based on the user's geographic location.

Geoproximity Routing : Adjusts routing based on user location and bias preferences.

Multi-Value Routing :Returns multiple healthy records for better load distribution.

4. Health Checks & Failover
---------------------------------
.Monitors the health of web applications and endpoints.
.Can automatically route traffic to healthy instances in case of failures.
.Supports CloudWatch integration for eal-time monitoring.



5. Private DNS for VPC
-----------------------------
Supports private DNS resolution within AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Hosted Zone
---------------
For one domain enters of all records are called as hosted zone
1.Public dns host zones
2. Private hosted zones


How Route 53 Works? (Step-by-Step)
------------------------------------
When a user visits www.example.com, Route 53 performs the following steps:
User enters a domain (www.example.com) in the web browser.
Browser queries the DNS resolver (ISP, Google DNS, or Cloudflare DNS).
DNS Resolver contacts Route 53 for the IP address.
Route 53 responds with the IP address (based on the routing policy)
Browser connecte to the web server hosting the website 
Website loads successfully .
  
AWS Route 53 Alisa vs Cname
----------------------------------
AWS Route 53 provides two ways to map domain names : Alisa record s and CNAME record.
while both serve similar purposes, they have key differences.

Alisa 
----------

An Alias record is a Route 53-specific record type that allows you to map a domain name 
directly to an AWS resource.

Key Features:
Works at the root domain level (e.g., example.com).
Free of charge (AWS does not charge for Alias lookups).
Routes directly to AWS services like:
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
I CloudFront distributions
API Gateway
S3 static website hosting 
Global Accelerator

Faster DNS resolution as it resolved within AWS

2. CNAME Record
----------------
Definition:A CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps one domain name to another domain name.
Key Features:
Cannot be used at the root domain (only for subdomains like www.example.com).

Failure routing policeis 
--------------------------
Uses Primary-Backup setup.
Routes traffic to the Primary resource
If Primary fails, traffic is redirected to Secondary (Failover).

Use Case
------------
Disaster Recovery (automatic failover to a backup site).
High availability for mission-critical apps


DNS
-------------

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system that 
translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.183.14), 
allowing computers to locate and communicate with each other over the internet or private networks.

Types of DNS Lookups
---------------------
1. Forward Lookup (Name to IP Translation)
- Converts a domain name into an IP address.
Example:
      * You enter www.example.com in your browser.
      *DNS resolves it to 192.168.1.10
- Used when clients want to connect to a server using a domain

2.Reverse lookup (ip to name transalation)
 . converts an ip address back into a domain name.
. Example 
. Example.com - 192.168.1.10


DNS Records and Their Explanation

DNS records are entries in a DNS server that map domain names to IP addresses and other important information. 
Here are the most common types of DNS records:

1. A Record (Address Record)
Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
Example:
example.com 192.168.1.10


2. AAAA Record (IPv6 Address Record)

. Maps a domain name to an ipv6 address 
. Example:
. Example.com - 2001:db8

3. CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record)
Creates an alias for another domain.
Used when multiple domain names should point to the same
website.
Example:
I www.example.com - example.com

4. MX Record (Mail Exchange Record)
Specifies mail servers responsible for receiving emails for a domain.
Example:
I example.com mail.example.com (Priority: 10)

5. PTR Record (Pointer Record)
Used for reverse DNS lookups (IP to domain name).
Example:
192.168.1.10 - example.com.

6. TXT Record (Text Record)
Stores text information, often used for verification and security.
Used in SPF, DKIM, and DMARC email security.
Example:
example.com - "v=spf1 include: spf.google.com"all"

7. NS Record (Name Server Record)
Specifies authoritative DNS servers for a domain
Example:
example.com -  ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com

8. SRV Record (Service Record)
Defines the location of services like SIP or LDAP
Example:
sip. tcp.example.com→ sipserver.example.com (Port: 5060)

9. SOA Record (Start of Authority Record)
Provides information about the domain's DNS zone.
Contains details like primary DNS server, email of the administrator, and refresh times.
Example:
example.com ns1.example.com (Admin: admin@example.com)

10. CAA Record (Certification Authority Authorization)
Restricts which Certificate Authorities (CAs) can issue SSL certificates for a domain.
Example:
example.com→0issue "letsenypt.org"

11. NAPTR Record (Naming Authority Pointer)

How DNS works
----------------
1. User Request: You enter a URL (e.g., www.example.com) into your browser or app. Your device needs the IP address to connect to the website's server.
2. Local DNS Resolver: Your device checks its local cache (browser or operating system) for the IP address. If not found, it queries a DNS resolver, usually provided by your ISP or a public service like Google DNS (8.8.8.8). 
3. Root Name Servers: If the resolver doesn't have the answer, it contacts one of the 13 global root name servers. These servers know the locations of Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (e.g., for .com, .org).
4.TLD Name Servers:The Root server directs the resolver to the TLD name server for the domain s extension (eg., com).The TLD server 

Provides the address of the authoritative name server for the specific domain.
5. provides the address of the authoritative name server for the specific domain, I

5. Authoritative Name Server: The resolver queries the authoritative name server, which holds the DNS records (e.g., A record for IPVA, AAAA for IPv6) for the domain. It returns the IP address.

6. Response to Device: The resolver sends the IP address back to your device, which caches it for future use. Your browser then uses this IP to connect to the website's server.

7. Connection: Your device communicates with the website's server, and the content loads.
