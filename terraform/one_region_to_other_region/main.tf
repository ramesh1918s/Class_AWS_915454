# Why?
# For high availability and disaster recovery, you deploy infrastructure in multiple AWS regions.

# You want to automate this in Terraform, so the same code creates resources in multiple regions.

# How to do in Terraform?
# You use multiple provider blocks with aliases â€” each configured for a different AWS region.

# Example Project: EC2 in us-east-1 (Primary) and EC2 in us-west-2 (Backup)
