✅ 1. What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP) using configuration files.

🔰 2. Basic Concepts
Concept	Description
Providers	Plugin to interact with cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure)
Resources	Infrastructure components (EC2, S3, etc.)
Variables	Input values for reusability
Outputs	Show useful information after apply
State file	.tfstate keeps track of resources
Modules	Reusable Terraform code blocks

⚙️ 3. Setup (Hands-on)
🧑‍💻 Prerequisites
AWS account

Install Terraform (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

Configure AWS CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws configure
📂 Project Structure
bash
Copy

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-04b4f1a9cf54c11d0"  # your AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

🧠 4. Real-Time Use Case: Complete AWS Infra with Terraform
You can use Terraform to provision:

VPC

Subnets (Public/Private)

IGW, NAT

Route Tables

Security Groups

EC2 Instances

RDS, S3, Load Balancer

Auto Scaling

✅ You can also integrate it in CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins → Terraform → AWS).

💬 5. Terraform in DevOps Interviews (Top Q&A)
Q1. What is Terraform and how is it different from CloudFormation?
A: Terraform is cloud-agnostic and supports multiple cloud providers. CloudFormation is AWS-specific.

Q2. What is the use of terraform.tfstate?
A: It tracks infrastructure deployed using Terraform for comparison during future runs.

Q3. What are Terraform modules?
A: Reusable, organized blocks of Terraform code.

Q4. How do you manage state files in a team?
A: Use Remote backends like S3 with DynamoDB for state locking.

🚀 6. Advanced Topics
Remote State (S3 + DynamoDB)

Workspaces (for multi-environment dev/test/prod)

Data sources

Provisioners

ChatGPT said:
This error means your IAM user (Bhanu) does not have permission to perform the ec2:RunInstances action — so Terraform fails when trying to create the EC2 instance.

🔒 Error Summary:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
UnauthorizedOperation: You are not authorized to perform: ec2:RunInstances
✅ Solution: Attach the Right IAM Policy
You need to give your IAM user permissions to launch EC2 instances.

🔧 Step-by-Step Fix:
✅ Option 1: Add AmazonEC2FullAccess to the IAM User







✅ Basic Example: terraform {} block
hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"  # or the version you prefer
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
}
🔧 If You're Using Remote Backend (S3)
If you want to store the Terraform state file remotely (in S3), use:

hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-s3-bucket-name"
    key            = "terraform/state.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"   # optional for state locking
  }
}
⚠️ If you're not using a remote backend yet, you can skip the backend block for now and keep it local.

🧠 TL;DR: Add terraform {} block in main.tf
Start with this for version control and provider lock:

hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
}
Let me know if you want help configuring the S3 remote backend or setting up multiple environments (dev/prod) with workspaces.







You said:
auto-approve command


ChatGPT said:
In Terraform, the -auto-approve flag is used with the terraform apply and terraform destroy commands to skip the interactive approval prompt.

✅ Usage
1. Apply without manual approval:
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
🚫 This skips the Do you want to perform these actions? prompt and applies changes immediately.

2. Destroy resources without confirmation:
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform destroy -auto-approve
⚠️ When to Use
Useful in automation scripts (CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

Avoid in sensitive environments unless you're confident about the plan.

Safer to first run:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
🧪 Example: Jenkins Script with Terraform
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
Let me know if you want a full Jenkins pipeline using Terraform — I’ll guide you step-by-step too.

ChatGPT said:
This error occurs because Terraform is trying to lock the state using a DynamoDB table, but the table (terraform-lock-table) does not exist in your AWS account.

🔍 Error Summary
pgsql
Copy
Edit
ResourceNotFoundException: Requested resource not found
Unable to retrieve item from DynamoDB table "terraform-lock-table"
✅ Solution: Create the DynamoDB Lock Table
Step-by-Step Guide
You need to manually create the DynamoDB table used for state locking:

📌 Create Lock Table in DynamoDB
Go to AWS Console > DynamoDB.

Click "Create table".

Use the following details:

Table name: terraform-lock-table

Partition key: LockID (type: String)

Leave everything else as default.

Click "Create".

💡 Optional: Create it via Terraform
If you'd like to automate it:

hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-lock-table"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}
✅ Once created:
You can now re-run:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
If the error still appears, ensure:

You're in the correct region

The table name in main.tf matches the actual DynamoDB table

Let me know if you'd like help configuring your backend block in main.tf properly.

Bujji, this error confirms that your DynamoDB table terraform-lock-table was not created properly — or it is not in the correct region.
